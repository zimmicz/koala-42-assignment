## How to run

```
npm i --no-audit
npm run dev
```

## What's missing

- possibility to nest the table infinitely
- possibility to delete entities on all levels
- better level of abstraction
- a way to easily identify array items
- a check to tell if an entity has children or not
- tests
- better UI

More than happy to discuss any of this! Tried to spend around two hours working on this.
